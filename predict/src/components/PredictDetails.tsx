            The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound
            of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target
            federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee
            (FOMC) meetings. This market will resolve to the amount of basis
            points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed
            by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's September
            2025 meeting. If the target federal funds rate is changed to a level
            not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded
            up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g.
            if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25
            bps) The resolution source for this market is the FOMC's statement
